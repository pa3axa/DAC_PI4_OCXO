# DAC based 10Mhz PI4 modulator. for CTI-OSC5A2B02 OCXO

This is a 10Mhz reference with PI-4 modulation\
for use in Microwave Beacons. It is selfcontained\
once programmed for the right frequency and Callsign\
in both FSK and PI4.

The board is designed around the CTI-OSC5A2B02 10Mhz\
OCXO which is still avialable for reasonable prices\
on AliExpress.

For PI4 operation a 1 PPM signal is needed to sync\
the transmission of PI4 to the start of the minute\

My other project Easy-1PPM can be used to provide\
this 1 PPM pulse

## Software is still in development
